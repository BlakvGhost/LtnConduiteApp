# LtnConduiteApp

A small web application designed for the first time on behalf of the LycÃ©e Technique de Natitingou for the vote of the pipes by teachers for each class.
It is mainly written with the Django framework and using JQuery in Front.
The application is divided into two parts:
  - A first for the school supervisor who can add and edit the list of teachers authorized to vote as well as view the results of the votes and the behavior retained for each class at the end of the votes.
  - A second for teachers, who can select their class and go to the voting stage, as well as the appreciation of the application.
